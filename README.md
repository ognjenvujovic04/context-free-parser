# Context-free Parser

This project implements a context-free grammar parser for English sentences. It's designed to analyze sentence structure, identify noun phrases, and demonstrate natural language processing capabilities. Part of CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python.

## Project Overview

The parser performs three main functions:
1. Preprocessing sentences into tokens
2. Parsing sentences according to context-free grammar rules
3. Extracting noun phrase chunks from parsed sentences

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Context-Free Grammar
